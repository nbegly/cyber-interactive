    type: "single",
    category: "2.1 Compare and contrast common threat actors and motivations.",
    answers: [
        { text: "A. Hacktivist", correct: false, explain: "Incorrect. A hacktivist is typically motivated by political or social beliefs, not hired by governments." },
        { text: "B. Whistleblower", correct: false, explain: "Incorrect. A whistleblower is an insider who exposes wrongdoing within an organization, not an external attacker." },
        { text: "C. Organized crime", correct: true, explain: "Correct. Nation-states may hire organized crime groups to conduct cyberattacks to create plausible deniability. These groups are motivated by financial gain and have the resources and skills for such tasks." },
        { text: "D. Unskilled attacker", correct: false, explain: "Incorrect. An unskilled attacker (or script kiddie) lacks the sophistication required for state-sponsored attacks on critical systems." }

    q: "Which of the following is used to add extra complexity before using a one-way data transformation algorithm?",
    type: "single",
    category: "1.4 Explain the importance of using appropriate cryptographic solutions.",
    answers: [
        { text: "A. Key stretching", correct: false, explain: "Incorrect. Key stretching involves running a password through a hashing algorithm thousands of times to make it harder to brute-force, but it doesn't add extra complexity *before* the initial transformation." },
        { text: "B. Data masking", correct: false, explain: "Incorrect. Data masking hides original data with modified content (e.g., showing only the last 4 digits of a credit card) but is not part of the hashing process." },
        { text: "C. Steganography", correct: false, explain: "Incorrect. Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video." },
        { text: "D. Salting", correct: true, explain: "Correct. Salting is the process of adding a unique, random string of characters (the salt) to a password before it is hashed. This ensures that even identical passwords result in different hashes, mitigating rainbow table attacks." }

    id: 3,

    type: "single",
    category: "2.2 Explain common threat vectors and attack surfaces.",
    answers: [
        { text: "A. Brand impersonation", correct: false, explain: "Incorrect. While brand impersonation is part of the attack, the overall technique of using email to trick a user into providing credentials via a malicious link is more specifically called phishing." },
        { text: "B. Pretexting", correct: false, explain: "Incorrect. Pretexting involves creating an invented scenario (the pretext) to engage a targeted victim in a way that increases the chance the victim will divulge information. While related, phishing is the more precise term here." },
        { text: "C. Typosquatting", correct: false, explain: "Incorrect. Typosquatting relies on users making typographical errors when entering a URL. This scenario involves clicking a link in an email." },
        { text: "D. Phishing", correct: true, explain: "Correct. Phishing is a social engineering attack that uses fraudulent emails or messages to trick recipients into revealing sensitive information, such as login credentials, by directing them to a malicious website." }
